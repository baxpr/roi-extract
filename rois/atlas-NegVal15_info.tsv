1	Accumbens_L_HO50	MNI152 linear	The NA was defined using the Harvard-Oxford atlas thresholded at a 50% probability (Desikan et al., 2006). 
2	Accumbens_R_HO50	MNI152 linear	The NA was defined using the Harvard-Oxford atlas thresholded at a 50% probability (Desikan et al., 2006). 
3	Amygdala_L_HO50	MNI152 linear	The amygdala was defined using the Harvard-Oxford atlas thresholded at a 50% probability (Desikan et al., 2006). 
4	Amygdala_R_HO50	MNI152 linear	The amygdala was defined using the Harvard-Oxford atlas thresholded at a 50% probability (Desikan et al., 2006). 
5	BNST_3t_L_90	MNI152 linear SPM	The BNST was defined using a mask previously created my our group using an ultra-high field (7T) MRI and a specialized GRASE sequence to trace the BNST (Avery et al., 2014). To ensure the BNST was engaged during the task, whole brain activation was examined. 
6	BNST_3t_R_90	MNI152 linear SPM	The BNST was defined using a mask previously created my our group using an ultra-high field (7T) MRI and a specialized GRASE sequence to trace the BNST (Avery et al., 2014). To ensure the BNST was engaged during the task, whole brain activation was examined. 
7	dACC	MNI152 linear SPM	
8	Hippocampus_Ant_L_HO	MNI152 linear	The anterior hippocampus was defined using the Harvard-Oxford atlas thresholded at a 50% probability (Desikan et al., 2006) using the additional boundary of the uncus to identify the anterior hippocampus. 
9	Hippocampus_Ant_R_HO	MNI152 linear	The anterior hippocampus was defined using the Harvard-Oxford atlas thresholded at a 50% probability (Desikan et al., 2006) using the additional boundary of the uncus to identify the anterior hippocampus. 
10	Hypothalamus_L	MNI152 linear SPM	The hypothalamus mask was created based on the Mai atlas using methods similar to those for the BNST (Avery et al., 2014). 
11	Hypothalamus_R	MNI152 linear SPM	The hypothalamus mask was created based on the Mai atlas using methods similar to those for the BNST (Avery et al., 2014). 
12	Insula_anterior_left	MNI152 linear SPM	The anterior insula was defined using a mask developed by Farb (2013) that has previously been used by our group to demonstrate anterior insula structural connectivity with the BNST (Flook et al., 2020)
13	Insula_anterior_right	MNI152 linear SPM	The anterior insula was defined using a mask developed by Farb (2013) that has previously been used by our group to demonstrate anterior insula structural connectivity with the BNST (Flook et al., 2020)
14	rACC	MNI152 linear SPM	
15	vmPFC	MNI152 linear SPM	The vmPFC mask was defined based on a 10mm sphere surrounding the peak point of vmPFC-BNST connectivity from a previous study [x = 0, y = 43, z = -9] (Avery et al., 2014).
